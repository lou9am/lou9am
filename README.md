### Hi there :]

Here are some info about me!
---

### In Progress Project : `binpacking_posco-v0` with RL
> It is a project in POSCO AI Academy 20th.<br>
> We sovle 2D-BPP with RL, especially with PPO! <br>
> #Keras #gym #custom_gym #2DBPP #RL #PPO #DQN

### Previous project
###### 1. ML based SOD Algorithm in MHE with `PCA-SVM model` and `CNN`
 > This is a projcet about SOD(Seat Occupancy Detection) Alogrithm using ML.(It is a Classfication Problem)<br>
 > With ultrasonic sensor, I got pre-processed 16x8 matrix signal.<br>
 > First of all, I used ML(not DL) models but It failed.<br>
 > So, I used CNN. Convert matrix into gray scale heatmap img, and training CNN.

###### 2. Big Data Analysis Project of MomQ (KOR Company selling Baby Products)
 > This is a project about Big Data with Python.
