### Hi there :]

Here are some info about me!
---

- In Progress Project : `binpacking_posco-v0` with RL
> It is a project in POSCO AI Academy 20th.
> We sovle 2D-BPP with RL, especially with PPO! <br>
> #Keras #gym #custom_gym #2DBPP #RL #PPO #DQN

- Previous project : ML based SOD Algorithm in MHE with `PCA-SVM model` and `CNN`
 > This is a projcet about SOD(Seat Occupancy Detection) Alogrithm using ML.
 > with ultrasonic sensor, I got pre-processed 16x8 matrix signal.
 > FOA, I used ML(not DL) models but It failed to classfication.
 > So, I used CNN. Convert matrix into gray scale heatmap img, and training CNN.
 
- Experienced MCUs in Univ : Raspberry pi, Arduino, AVR etc
> Communications : Serial, UART/USART, CAN

- Interests : AI(ML, DL), Data Analysis, Embedded Project
- Others : GenshinImpact AR 59 :]
